# FregeAndroid
A proof of concept for running Frege on Android

Steps to run:

* Download the frege compiler version 3.24.100.1-jdk7. Open the jar file with an archive manager like 7zip and delete the run8 folder.
* Add the jar to the app's build.gradle dependencies (replace my path with yours)
* Replace all instances in build.gradle with your relative paths.
 
 That should be all.
